# Beat Buster

A discord bot that can stream music straight into your voice channels.

## Background

Since YouTube has been banning many of the popular music streaming bots such as Groovy and Rhytm. I decided to make my own bot that can stream music straight from YouTube.

## Features

Currently supported features:

- Stream music from YouTube using a direct link
- Search for songs on YouTube and stream them
- Pause, resume, and skip songs
- Queue songs
- Search for songs using Spotify links
- Queue Spotify playlists and albums

## Bot Link

I will not be making this bot public due to the nature of it being able to stream music straight from YouTube. If you would like to use this bot, you can host it yourself at your own risk.
